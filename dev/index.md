title: Developer Manual
---

This subsection of the manual is intended for those who work on the Luther Navigator application. It is expected that developers who read this part of the manual are familiar with [git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and other technologies commonly associated with modern computer programming and full-stack development. We also assume devs are familiar with the languages used in this project (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL).

## [Extending the Manual](./manual)

This manual should only need to be changed when significant changes are made to the application. If a change to the Luther Navigator project causes the manual to be inaccurate or incomplete in any way, the manual should be appropriately updated.

## [Scripts](./scripts)

The project repository contains several Python scripts which serve various purposes.

## [Deployment](./deployment)

The application is deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). We do not assume devs are familiar with Heroku, but experience with it will certainly speed things up.

## [Repositories](./repos)

We have [an organization](https://github.com/LutherNavigator) for all of our repositories on GitHub, including one for [the project itself](https://github.com/LutherNavigator/LutherNavigator).

## [Project Design](./design)

[The project](https://github.com/LutherNavigator/LutherNavigator) has a very specific design which we expect future developers to understand and follow when making changes.

## [Miscellaneous](./misc)

Developers should be aware of a few miscellaneous things.
