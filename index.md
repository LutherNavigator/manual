title: Luther Navigator Manual
---

This manual contains a series of documents describing the layout of the Luther Navigator site to admins and developers.

## [Admin Manual](./admin)

The site features a [control panel](https://www.luthernavigator.com/admin) exclusive to admins. The admin manual contains information on how to use each section of the admin control panel and other similar features.

## [Developer Manual](./dev)

Documentation for all things relevant to developers is quite a bit more extensive. It includes detailed descriptions of everything from the project architecture to how deployment is set up to how to extend the application.

## User Manual

The site itself serves as a manual for users, as it is sufficiently self-documenting. [The about page](https://www.luthernavigator.com/about) is also a source of information about the site for users.

## Further Questions

We hope this manual covers everything, but if it does not, you can contact us (the original developers) using the information below. Please note that the project lead is most likely to be able to answer technical questions involving the application.
