# Developer Manual

This subsection of the manual is intended for those who work on the LutherNavigator application. It is expected that developers who read this part of the manual are familiar with [git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and other technologies commonly associated with modern computer programming. We also assume devs are familiar with the languages used in this project (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL).

## [Extending the Manual](/dev/manual)

This manual should only need to be changed when significant changes are made to the application. In the event that a change to the LutherNavigator project causes the manual to be inaccurate or incomplete in any way, the manual should be appropriately updated.
