# LutherNavigator Manual

This manual contains a series of documents describing the layout of the LutherNavigator site to admins and developers.

## Admin Manual

The site features a [control panel](https://www.luthernavigator.com/admin) exclusive to admins. Information on how to use each section of the admin control panel and other similar features can be found [here](/admin).

## Developer Manual

Documentation for all things relevant to developers is quite a bit more extensive. It includes detailed descriptions of everything from the project architecture to how deployment is set up to how to extend the application. It can be found [here](/developer).

## User Manual

The site itself serves as a manual for users, as it is sufficiently self-documenting. [The about page](https://www.luthernavigator.com/about) is also a source of information about the site for users.
