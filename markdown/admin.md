# Admin Manual

The main feature that admins have access to is the control panel. There are also a couple of admin-related features which are not built into the control panel as well.

## [Admin Control Panel](/admin/control-panel)

The control panel allows admins to monitor and control various parts of the site. We advise that the control panel be used in a desktop environment, rather than on a mobile device.

## Adding Admins

The process of actually making a user an admin is somewhat less straightforward than it would seem. We do have a feature which allows you to list the site admins, promote a user an admin, and remove a user's admin status. For security purposes, this feature was not put into the admin control panel. To access any part of this feature (i.e. make a user an admin), ask a developer. The feature is documented for developers on [this page](/dev/scripts).
